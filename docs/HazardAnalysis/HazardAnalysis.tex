\section{Introduction}

A hazard is any property or condition that has the potential to cause harm. This
document serves as a hazard analysis for the application revolving around the
capstone project "Alkalytics". This project aims to aids in the data management
and analysis of an ocean alkalinity enhancement experiment. This document
identifies the components of the system, and then the possible software hazards
in these components, as well as ways to mitigate the risks they impose.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of the hazard analysis is to identify potential hazards and its
causes, assess the effects, and set mitigation strategies to eliminate or lessen
the risk of the hazard. It is important to consider all possible hazards
associated with the Alkalytics project and its components, as the following
losses could be incurred from an insufficient hazard assessment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data loss: The data gets unintentionally lost, deleted, or corrupted.
    \item Data integrity: The data is not complete, accurate, nor correct which
    can lead to computational errors.
    \item System availability: Users are unable to access the system due to
    factors such as unstable internet connection or server crashes.
    \item Security: If there are no proper measures for authentication,
    unauthorized access to the data or user information may occur.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

The following are assumptions made about the software of the system. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The data provided to this system is validated and correctly formatted
    before system ingestion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Errors can occur from badly formatted or invalid incoming data,
        which is not something the system can control
    \end{itemize}
    \item The user of this application is not intentionally trying to misuse it
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This assumption mitigates the risk of someone intentionally
        damaging the system
    \end{itemize}
    \item Internet connection and server infrastructure will always be
    available, and will not suddenly go down and compromise the system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This assumption mitigates the risk of a failing internet
        connection or fragile server infrastructure interrupting the system
    \end{itemize}
    \item Users using this application understand how to use the application,
    whether through documentation or a tutorial
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This assumptions ensures that user errors caused by lack of
        knowledge do not occur
    \end{itemize}
    \item The system is regularly maintained for security and bug fixes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This assumption prevents any threats to the system due to poor
        maintenance
    \end{itemize}
    \item The system is scalable and possesses enough computational resources to
    handle any volume of data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This assumption mitigates the risk of the system failing due to
        lack of resources
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
New safety and security requirements have been discovered and will be integrated
within the SRS document. Note that the entire requirement codes have been
changed with the new additions having expanded information, and the previous
requirements displaying new codes.

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\textbf{SR-1.} Access to the application must be restricted to authorized
  personnel, with an authentication mechanism. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-2.} Only authenticated users should have the ability to query or
  modify the data, and each user’s access must be limited to their capabilities
  within the application. \ \\
  \ \\
\textbf{SR-3.} The application must restrict sensitive operations (e.g., data export)
  to authorized personnel only.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Rationale:} Prevents unauthorized users from exporting or
      sharing sensitive data, protecting data integrity.
      \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} Only authorized users must be able to
      perform sensitive operations like data export.
      \item \textit{Traceability:} FR-15, SR-2.
    \end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{SR-4.} The application must enforce session timeout and automatic logouts
after a period of inactivity.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Rationale:} Protects the application from unauthorized access if
    users leave their session unattended.
    \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} Sessions must time out and log users off
    automatically after a specified inactivity period.
    \item \textit{Traceability:} FR-14, SR-1, SR-4.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\textbf{SR-5.} The application must validate data inputs to ensure they conform
  to expected formats and values before they are processed. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-6.} The application must not modify the data unnecessarily through
  its transfer process. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-7.} The application must ensure that any data processed or
  transferred is free from duplication or inconsistencies. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-8.} The application must have safeguards in place to maintain the
  accuracy of the transferred data. \ \\
  \ \\
\textbf{SR-9.} The application must validate CSV data thoroughly before upload to
prevent corrupted or incomplete data entries.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Rationale:} Ensures that only valid, complete, and accurate
    data enters the application to prevent faulty analysis.
    \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} The application shall reject any data that
    does not meet the validation criteria.
    \item \textit{Traceability:} FR-3, FR-4.
  \end{itemize}
\ \\

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\textbf{SR-10.} All personal information related to experimental participants or
  stakeholders, if applicable, must be anonymized and handled in accordance with
  relevant privacy laws and regulations. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-11.} The application must restrict data sharing with external parties
  unless expressly authorized by stakeholders, and users must be fully informed
  about the privacy policies. \ \\
  \ \\
  \textbf{SR-12.} The application must monitor database storage capacity and alert
  administrators when thresholds are reached to prevent application crashes.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Rationale:} Ensures the application continues operating smoothly
      by addressing storage limits proactively.
      \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} The application shall send alerts when storage
      capacity exceeds 80\% usage.
      \item \textit{Traceability:} PR-12, PR-13.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Audit Requirements}
\textbf{SR-13.} The application must maintain a comprehensive audit trail,
  logging all access and modification events, including timestamps and
  identities of users performing actions. \ \\
\ \\
\textbf{SR-14.} Audit logs must be securely stored and accessible only by
  authorized personnel. \ \\
  \ \\
  \textbf{SR-15.} The application must display real-time 
  error logs to users to enhance troubleshooting when applicable.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Rationale:} Ensures users are informed about application issues
      and can take corrective action promptly.
      \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} All errors must be logged and displayed
      clearly to users in real-time.
      \item \textit{Traceability:} FR-12, MSR-5.
    \end{itemize}
  

\subsection{Immunity Requirements}
\textbf{SR-16.} The application must have proactive measures to detect and
  mitigate suspicious activities, such as repeated unauthorized access attempts,
  ensuring the application remains secure at all times. \ \\
  \ \\
  \textbf{SR-17.} Real-time monitoring and optimization of application resources must
  be implemented to avoid crashes due to resource overload.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Rationale:} Prevents application downtime by ensuring efficient
      use of CPU and memory.
      \item \textit{Fit Criterion:} The application must manage memory and CPU usage
      dynamically to avoid overloads.
      \item \textit{Traceability:} PR-4, PR-9.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Roadmap}
The following table outlines a proposed roadmap of when each safety requirement
will be implemented within the capstone timeline and justifications.
