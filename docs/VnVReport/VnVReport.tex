\section{Overview}
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Verification and
Validation (VnV) process for the Alkalytics project. It includes reports and
analysis of system testing and unit testing results, along with traceability
between test cases, the software modules in the
\href{https://github.com/SumanyaG/Alkalytics/blob/main/docs/Design/MG.pdf}{Module
Guide} (MG), and the requirements outlined in the
\href{https://github.com/SumanyaG/Alkalytics/blob/f856af96669275cc29428a8f2cd4b863e4523ff6/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software
Requirements Specification} (SRS). Additionally, it highlights changes made to
the implementation based on testing outcomes and user feedback.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Unit Testing}

\subsection{Data Storage Module}
\subsection{Data Retrieval Module}
\subsection{Visualization Module}
\subsection{User Management Module}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
\subsection{Changes Due to Supervisor Feedback}

Our supervisor suggested the current data visualization form intake could be
improved by allowing the user to filter the experiment data by additional
parameters, rather than only by the date it was performed. This feature will be
added to the final product.

They have also requested to add a new feature that was not originally part of
the requirements. This feature allows the user to compute a variety of
efficiency factors related to the data, measuring the efficiencies of the
membrane used in the experiment. This feature will be added to the final
product, but thorough validation testing will be limited due to time
constraints.


\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from the
supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular the
feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) should be
highlighted.}

\subsection{Changes Due to Failed Tests}
\subsubsection{\hyperref[NFR:S3]{NFR-S3}} The system did not automatically log
out the user after a period of inactivity. This was due to the lack of a session
timeout manager, which will be implemented in the final product.

\section{Automated Testing}
Pytest was used as the automated testing framework for Python. Unit test suites
were written and executed using Pytest, which supports fixtures,
parameterization, and code coverage metrics, making automated testing more
efficient and flexible.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}

  Writing the general structure of the report was straightforward as we could
  refer back to the tests we had written in the VnV Plan (cont. later)

  \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and
  how did you resolve them?}

  Constructing and executing all of our tests was the biggest challenge. Due to
  time constraints, (cont. later)

  \item \textbf{Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your
  client(s) or a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?}

  \item \textbf{In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan
  different from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there
  were differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)}
