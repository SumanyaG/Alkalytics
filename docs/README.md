Notes from Dr. Smith:
- For some cases, like the design documentation, you are required to document your design, but it may not be via a module guide and module interface specification documents.
- The files and folders have been set-up with tex files that have external links so that cross-referencing is possible between documents.
- The files use Comments.tex so that the comments package can be used to embed comments into the generated pdf. Comments can be set to false so that they do not appear.
