\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}
This section covers all tests for different areas of the system.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The subsections below covers each major functional of the application, from uploading data to the various outputs of post query analysis. Many of the functions come from the same user flow. By testing the subsections below guarintees that all possible user flows involving the main application functioanlities are working as expected. 

\subsubsection{Data Input and Storage}
The tests below provide a way to evaluate the correctness of data input and storagee for the following functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FR-1
  \item FR-2
  \item FR-3
  \item FR-4
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-SLN1}

Control: Manual
					
Initial State: Database is running and ready to intake data
					
Input: Dataset to be stored, in .CSV format
					
Output: Data that is inputted is sent into the system, then labelled and stored successfully

Test Case Derivation: When the data is sent to the system, the data should be stored somewhere and labelled properly before it can be queried.
					
How test will be performed: The test can be performed by sending a test sample of varying sizes to the storage in the system.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Querying and Results}
Th tests below provide a way to evaluate the data querying and visualization process of the system for the following functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FR-5
  \item FR-6
  \item FR-7
  \item FR-8
  \item FR-9
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item{FR-SLN2}
  
  Control: Manual
            
  Initial State: The system is not running any jobs, and the user interface is cleared. 
            
  Input: A selection of different combinations of parameters and datasets to be queried on
            
  Output: A human-readable and customizable visualization of correct results corresponding to the selected paramters from the input
  
  Test Case Derivation: The expected output of the system is based on the query parameters selected. A user expects the data analysis to match with what they asked for, and the user is allowed to customize the visuallized data.
            
  How test will be performed: The database will be queried using multiple combinations of parameters, and the results will be compared against the expected output. The outputted visualization will then be tested for customizability.
  
  \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
    The tests below provide a way to evaluate the data analysis in the application for the following functional requirements:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item FR-10
      \item FR-11
    \end{itemize}
      \begin{enumerate}
      
        \item{FR-SLN3}
        
        Control: Manual
                  
        Initial State: The application's cleared user interface which has not yet been used to query data, with no graph showing yet.
                  
        Input: A combination of parameters to query on for a selected dataset
                  
        Output: A small written human-readable paragraph explaining the input data.
       
        Test Case Derivation: To be able to understand the returned data in ways other than through a graph, a written response gives the user a variety of choices.
                 
        How test will be performed: The website interface will allow the user to pick a written analysis response. The application will look for patterns and trends in the data and will output the findings. 
        
        \end{enumerate}


      \subsubsection{Data Hygiene}
      The tests below provide a way to evaluate how the application maintains the data hygiene of the datasets related to the following functional requirements:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item FR-12
        \item FR-13
      \end{itemize}
        \begin{enumerate}
        
          \item{FR-SLN4}
          
          Control: Manual
                    
          Initial State: The application's cleared user interface which has not yet been used to query data, with no graph showing yet.
                    
          Input: Dataset to be stored, in .CSV format
                    
          Output: A log file documenting errors found in the input data and/or removals of missing data.
          
          Test Case Derivation: This is to ensure the efficency of the querying and ensuring the database is only as big as it needs to be. This will also ensure that errors are dealt with by the application and are recorded to document any inconsistancies to increase traceability.
                    
          How test will be performed: After loading in a CSV file with some error in the data. A log file will be generated documenting the error after the application attempts to fix it. 
          
          \end{enumerate}

          \subsubsection{User Access}
          This tests below provide a way to evaluate how the application allows for user login related to the following functional requirements:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item FR-14
          \end{itemize}
            \begin{enumerate}
            
              \item{FR-SLN5}
              
              Control: Manual
                        
              Initial State: User interface shows a login page, with no login credentials currently used
                        
              Input: Sample user credentials
                        
              Output: The page redirects to the page designated after login
              
              Test Case Derivation: The system must be able to authenticate users properly, and when authenticated, they should be given access to the application
                        
              How test will be performed: Sample credentials with different combinations of characters will be used to log in to ensure the fields handle credentials correctly.  
              
              \end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection{Data Export}
  The tests below provide a way to evaluate the export of query reports after a session for the following functional requirement:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item FR-15
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{FR-SLN6}
    Control: Manual

    Initial State: User interface after multiple usages of data queries

    Input: User clicking the button for saving or downloading

    Output: Query report will be downloaded to the user's device

    Test Case Derivation: The user needs to be able to get a system generated report of the queries from their session, and be able to save or download that report as needed.

    How Test Will Be Performed: After making multiple queries on the data, the save/download button will be pressed to test functionality.
  \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
