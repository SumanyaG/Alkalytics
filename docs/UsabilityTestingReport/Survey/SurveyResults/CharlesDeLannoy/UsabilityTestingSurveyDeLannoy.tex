\section{Navigation Tasks to be Performed}
For the purpose of this usability session, the subject has been asked to perform the following tasks, in order:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Upload a data sheet.
  \item Upload another data sheet with the same experiment date.
  \item Locate this data sheet in the table view page.
  \item Navigate to the experiment table and perform the following operations -
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add a new row.
    \item Delete an existing row.
    \item Add a new column.
    \item Delete an existing column.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Calculate the average of any couple of values in the experiment table.
  \item \emph{(Optional):} Perform additional excel-based functions on the values in the experiment table.
  \item Search for a datapoint in the table using the column and value.
  \item Generate a graph using all available customization options for the experiment data from \textbf{September 26}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{User Answers}

Users will be asked the following questions to gauge the usability of the
application during a user demo assessment. These questions relate to
the assessment of non-functional tests NFR-LF1, NFR-UH1, NFR-OE2, and NFR-MS1 outlined in the
