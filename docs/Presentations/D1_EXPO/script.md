# Alkalytics EXPO Video Script
[Title Scene: Footage of ocean with a blue filter and a visualization displaying the application's name and one line description.]

[Opening Scene: Footage of ocean waves, overlaid with a soft, inspiring music track.]

(Voiceover - Jennifer): The ocean is one of our most powerful allies in the fight against climate change. As the world's largest carbon sink, it absorbs nearly a third of the carbon dioxide we emit but rising emissions are pushing the ocean's natural balance to its limits. Scientists have been working on rectifying this through a process called Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement.

[Cut to clip of Heriot-Watt University Professor explaining what OAE is.]

(Clip Transcript): "a method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by enhancing a natural process that the Earth does over a geological time period. So, we are trying to speed that up to human timescales so we can do something about climate change."

[Cut to picture of de Lannoy and Abdelkader.]

(Voiceover - Jason): Researchers at the de Lannoy lab at McMaster University led by Dr. Charles de Lannoy and his post-doctoral fellow Bassel A. Abdelkader have been testing a promising carbon removal process.

[Cut to picture of BMED machine.]

(Voiceover - Jason): This is being achieved using an approach known as bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). Large amounts of data must be analyzed to optimize this process and make it scalable. That's where Alkalytics comes in.

[Transition to animated screen recording of Alkalytics.]

(Voiceover - Kate): Alkalytics is a cutting edge data management system designed to support OAE research by consolidating experiment data. With this application, users gain access to:

[Cut to screen recording of the dashboard.]

(Voiceover - Kate): A centralized dashboard for quick insights.

[Cut to screen recording of table view showing excel calculation and other functions.]

(Voiceover - Kate): Interactive filtering and customization to refine results. Apart from using all available functions in excel which have been replicated in this application, 

[Cut to image of excel file with efficiency calculations formulas followed by clip of modal on the application.]

(Voiceover - Kate): the user can also say goodbye to complex formulas for efficiency calculations which are now just one click away.

[Cut to clip of upload page.]

(Voiceover - Sumanya): This is all facilitated by seamless data uploads with validation checks, allowing the user to upload their data hassle-free

[Cut to fast-forwarded clip of graphics modal filling and graph generation.]

(Voiceover - Sumanya): and supported by a variety of graphical analysis tools to track experiment trends.

[Cut to stock footage of programming.]

(Voiceover - Jason): Built using React, TypeScript, Python and MongoDB, Alkalytics ensures a smooth and efficient user experience. 

(Voiceover - Jennifer): This, however, is just the beginning. Future improvements for Alkalytics includes machine learning integration and implementation of enhanced analytical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and more.
