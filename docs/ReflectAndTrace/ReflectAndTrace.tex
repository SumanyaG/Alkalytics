\maketitle

% \plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
% learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
% document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
% feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
% important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
% Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
% on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}
This section summarizes the feedback received on various documents throughout
the course of the project as well as feedback on the product itself.

This information is summarized in tables, with the feedback in one
column (some are paraphrased for conciseness), the source of the feedback in the
next column, the change made in response to the feedback in the third column,
and a link to the issue in the last column. 

For documentation related sections, each item of feedback has a
link to the issue that addresses the change wih a link to the specific commit.
For feedback and changes related to code, specific commits or issue links are
not provided.

% \plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
% feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
% supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

% \plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
% from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
% supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

% \plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
% and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
% the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
% changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation, you
% can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the links are
% helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of feedback so
% that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the need to click
% on everything to find out.}

% \plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
% and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
% need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
% each item of feedback.}

% \plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
% recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source of
% that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
% response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
% The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to the
% feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the feedback and
% response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

% \plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
% be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
% document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
% low.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}
This section outlines the challenge level and extras for the Alkalytics project.

\subsection{Challenge Level}

The challenge level for this project has been identified as \textbf{general}.
This was determined from the domain knowledge, implementation challenges, and
complexity that the project demands. There was no research component or extra
domain knowledge required for the project to be considered advanced.
% \plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

The two extras completed as part of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Usability Testing Report}: A comprehensive report
    detailing the assessment of the application's usablity, including the
    objectives, methodologies, results of the conducted usability testing
    sessions, and the changes proposed and implemented based on user feedback.
    \item[(b)] \textbf{User Manual}: A detailed guide outlining the
    application's features, installation and usage instructions, and
    troubleshooting steps for common issues.
\end{itemize}

% \plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
% can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
% proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
% been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsubsection{Team Meeting Plan}
The team held weekly meetings on Fridays during the fall term, as outlined in
the Development Plan. In the winter term, these meetings were rescheduled to
Mondays during tutorial time. Most meetings were conducted virtually via
Microsoft Teams, with additional sessions scheduled as needed, particularly
leading up to deadlines. Meeting structures followed the Development Plan, with
a designated chair preparing an agenda and a note taker recording and posting
meeting minutes to the corresponding issue in the repository.

Meetings with the primary supervisor, Dr. Charles de Lannoy, were infrequent and
primarily virtual due to scheduling constraints and a mutual decision that
biweekly meetings were not necessary. During the fall term, most supervisory
meetings were held with the secondary supervisor, Bassel Abdelkader, who
provided updates to Dr. de Lannoy, reducing the need for separate meetings.

The team met with Bassel on a weekly basis, transitioning to biweekly meetings
as the project progressed. These meetings were conducted virtually. Beginning in
the winter term, Bassel was no longer available, and the team shifted to
meetings with Dr. de Lannoy instead, with Bassel attending when possible.

Additionally, the team met three times with Meghna Saha, an undergraduate
student in the research lab whose work aligned with the objectives of
Alkalytics. These meetings focused on knowledge transfer and conducting a
usability testing session.

\subsubsection{Team Communication Plan}
As outlined in the Development Plan, the team primarily communicated through an
Instagram group chat, supplemented by Microsoft Teams for resource sharing
(external files, sample works, etc).

GitHub was used for version control and issue tracking. While issues were
effectively utilized for assigning and tracking most tasks, they were not
consistently used for all deliverables. Issues were primarily employed for
meeting logs and managing feedback-related changes. Code-related tasks were not
tracked through issues; instead, individual branches and pull requests were used
to manage and review code changes.


\subsubsection{Team Member Roles}
The team largely adhered to the roles and rotation of roles outlined in the
Development Plan. The meeting chair and notetaker for the stages in the Project
Decomposition and Scheduling section was roughly as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 1 - 2}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Sumanya Gulati
            \item Notetaker: Jennifer Ye
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 2 - 3}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Jason Tran
            \item Notetaker: Kate Min
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 3 - 5}
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Jennifer Ye
            \item Notetaker: Sumanya Gulati
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 5 - 7}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Kate Min
            \item Notetaker: Jason Tran
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

One deviation from the Development Plan was the decision not to appoint a
primary reviewer for pull requests, as the team deemed it unnecessary to
have a single official ``approver'' in order to merge. Instead, pull requests
were reviewed and approved by team members as needed.

Roles related to implementation remained aligned with the Development Plan, with
tasks divided based on each team member’s respective strengths, as initially
outlined.
