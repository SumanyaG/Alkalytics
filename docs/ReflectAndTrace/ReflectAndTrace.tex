\maketitle

% \plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
% learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
% document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
% feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
% important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several CEAB
% (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be
% assessed based on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}
This section summarizes the feedback received on various documents throughout
the course of the project as well as feedback on the product itself.\\

This information is summarized in tables, with the feedback in one column (some
are paraphrased for conciseness), the source of the feedback in the next column,
the change made in response to the feedback in the third column, and a link to
the issue in the last column. \\

For documentation related sections, each item of feedback has a link to the
issue that addresses the change wih a link to the specific commit. For feedback
and changes related to code, specific commits or issue links are not provided.

% \plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
% feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
% supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

% \plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the
% feedback from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should
% highlight the supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

% \plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
% and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
% the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
% changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation,
% you can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the
% links are helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of
% feedback so that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the
% need to click on everything to find out.}

% \plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between
% feedback and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will
% instead need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in
% response to each item of feedback.}

% \plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
% recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source
% of that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
% response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
% The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to
% the feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the
% feedback and response separately for each deliverable in the sections that
% follow.}

% \plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
% be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
% document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
% low.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}
This section outlines the challenge level and extras for the Alkalytics project.

\subsection{Challenge Level}

The challenge level for this project has been identified as \textbf{general}.
This was determined from the domain knowledge, implementation challenges, and
complexity that the project demands. There was no research component or extra
domain knowledge required for the project to be considered advanced.
% \plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
% Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
% statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
% course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

The two extras completed as part of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Usability Testing Report}: A comprehensive report
    detailing the assessment of the application's usablity, including the
    objectives, methodologies, results of the conducted usability testing
    sessions, and the changes proposed and implemented based on user feedback.
    \item[(b)] \textbf{User Manual}: A detailed guide outlining the
    application's features, installation and usage instructions, and
    troubleshooting steps for common issues.
\end{itemize}

% \plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
% can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
% proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
% been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

% \plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
% the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

% \plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
% client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
% response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
% it led to.}
The evolution of the application's design can be directly traced to client feedback 
through the various milestones - from Proof of Concept till the Final Demo. A few notable 
examples are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allowing multiple files with the same name to be uploaded to the system. The clint 
    mentioned that sometimes, the CSV files generated by the BMED machine are split across multiple 
    files to store all the datapoints. Additionally, if multiple experiments are performed on the same 
    day, the generated files would have the same names but diffferent contents. To effectively deal 
    with this situation, our team modified the application's data migration algorithm to be more robust 
    by adding additional validation checks so that files with the same name are accepted by the system, the 
    datapoints are validated against the existing content in the database and then the content is either 
    added (if not already in the database) or discarded.
    \item During one of the usability testing sessions, it was discovered that the naming convention for 
    the upload page generated confusion and the user was not provided with enough details to make a sound choice.
    This was addressed by the team by, replacing the names with something more descriptive and then adding 
    additional information and help buttons informing the user about actions they can take and to aid them 
    through the upload process.
    \item Minor changes such as the content displayed on the dashboard (for quick insights) and adding a welcome 
    message to the dashboard were incorporated based on the user feedback. The feedback stated that the dashboard and 
    data pages seemed alike since they present, on the first glance, the same information. This was rectified 
    by adding the welcome message and switching the information table to display efficiency calculations instead 
    of a file data view.
    \item Post-Rev 0 demo, the client mentioned that although the application is on the correct track, it does not 
    provide sufficient analyses options. Up until that point, the only analysis option available was to generate 
    graphs to visualize the data. Based on further communication with the client, new requirements were added and 
    a few new features such as regression calculation (displaying a regression line and conclusion for scatter plots) 
    and efficiency calculations were added as additional functionalities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

% \plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
%  assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
%  separately.}
The limitations, assumptions and constraints that influenced our team's design decisions have 
been summarized below.
\subsection{Limitations}
We were limited by the fact that we had no control over how the machine output the data. This 
restricted how much we could optimize or influence the formatting at the source, and instead forced our 
system to adapt flexibly on the ingestion end. Another limitation was that not all key metrics (like 
efficiency factors) were directly available from the machine-generated files — some needed to be calculated 
or derived post-upload, requiring us to build additional logic into the backend.

\subsection{Assumptions}
We assumed users (researchers and lab assistants) would have a base level of technical comfort, allowing 
for an interface that supports filtering, uploading, and interacting with data without extensive onboarding. 
We also assumed that experiment formats and key parameters (e.g., pH levels, timestamps) would be consistent across 
files. This assumption was in conjunction with the fact that all experiments are conducted using the BMED machine 
and the likelihood of the data generation format changing is extremely low. These assumptions guided our UI/UX choices 
and influenced our selection of tools like React, D3, and MongoDB.

\subsection{Constraints}
Time and team size were the largest constraints. Given our four-person team and limited development time, we prioritized 
MVP-level functionality: dashboard overview, graph visualization, and basic analytics. Scalability and advanced features 
like multi-user permissions (beyond simple admin and researcher level roles) and automation were scoped for future iterations. 
Additionally, due to resource constraints, we relied on open-source technologies such as React, GraphQL, and MongoDB, avoiding 
any expensive licenses.

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

% \plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing
% your product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you
% could sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you
% have to sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold,
% like an open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many
% potential users currently exist?}

We believe that yes, there is a niche but promising market for this product. Alkalytics is 
tailored for research groups and labs conducting experiments in ocean alkalinity enhancement 
(OAE) using BMED or similar carbon capture technology. With the global push toward carbon 
dioxide removal (CDR), many academic and private institutions are investing in scalable, 
ocean-based carbon sequestration methods — all of which require robust data handling and 
visualization tools. \\

The most effective approach would be targeting academic institutions, environmental research 
organizations, and government-funded labs. Marketing could involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attending and presenting at climate science or chemical engineering conferences.
    \item Partnering with early adopters like McMaster’s De Lannoy Lab to serve as reference clients.
    \item Publishing an open-access paper or case study demonstrating its research impact.
\end{itemize}

The estimate to develop a production-ready version of Alkalytics (built on top of the existing application) 
is approximately \$10,000, broken down as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developer Time}: Approximately 150-190 hours at \$50/hour for frontend, backend, 
    database, testing and deployment.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure and Hosting}: \$600-700/year for cloud database, frontend hosting, domain and SSL.
    \item \textbf{Design and Documentation}: \$500-750 for UI/UX polish, branding, and user onboarding.
\end{itemize}

This estimate assumes the use of cost-efficient, open-source technologies, as done in the current version.

A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) pricing model could work well, with subscription tiers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basic Plan}: \$20/month for smaller research teams.
    \item \textbf{Professional Plan}: \$50/month for institutions with multiple users and experiments.
\end{itemize}

At \$25/month average revenue per user, we would need to sell 400 subscriptions to recoup the \$10,000 cost 
(400 x \$25 = \$10,000). Alternatively, offering a free tier for small-scale projects and a premium version for 
enterprise-level needs could encourage adoption. \\

Initial adoption could come from 100–200 labs globally working on CDR, desalination, or membrane-based 
electrochemical research. The user base is expected to grow with increased climate funding and regulatory 
focus on ocean-based solutions.

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}
Different aspects of our project management and how they compare to our development 
plan have been summarized below.

\subsubsection{Team Meeting Plan}
The team held weekly meetings on Fridays during the fall term, as outlined in
the Development Plan. In the winter term, these meetings were rescheduled to
Mondays during tutorial time. Most meetings were conducted virtually via
Microsoft Teams, with additional sessions scheduled as needed, particularly
leading up to deadlines. Meeting structures followed the Development Plan, with
a designated chair preparing an agenda and a note taker recording and posting
meeting minutes to the corresponding issue in the repository. \\

Meetings with the primary supervisor, Dr. Charles de Lannoy, were infrequent and
primarily virtual due to scheduling constraints and a mutual decision that
biweekly meetings were not necessary. During the fall term, most supervisory
meetings were held with the secondary supervisor, Bassel Abdelkader, who
provided updates to Dr. de Lannoy, reducing the need for separate meetings. \\

The team met with Bassel on a weekly basis, transitioning to biweekly meetings
as the project progressed. These meetings were conducted virtually. Beginning in
the winter term, Bassel was no longer available, and the team shifted to
meetings with Dr. de Lannoy instead, with Bassel attending when possible. \\

Additionally, the team met three times with Meghna Saha, an undergraduate
student in the research lab whose work aligned with the objectives of
Alkalytics. These meetings focused on knowledge transfer and conducting a
usability testing session.

\subsubsection{Team Communication Plan}
As outlined in the Development Plan, the team primarily communicated through an
Instagram group chat, supplemented by Microsoft Teams for resource sharing
(external files, sample works, etc). \\

GitHub was used for version control and issue tracking. While issues were
effectively utilized for assigning and tracking most tasks, they were not
consistently used for all deliverables. Issues were primarily employed for
meeting logs and managing feedback-related changes. Code-related tasks were not
tracked through issues; instead, individual branches and pull requests were used
to manage and review code changes.

\subsubsection{Team Member Roles}
The team largely adhered to the roles and rotation of roles outlined in the
Development Plan. The meeting chair and notetaker for the stages in the Project
Decomposition and Scheduling section was roughly as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 1 - 2}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Sumanya Gulati
            \item Notetaker: Jennifer Ye
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 2 - 3}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Jason Tran
            \item Notetaker: Kate Min
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 3 - 5}
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Jennifer Ye
            \item Notetaker: Sumanya Gulati
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stages 5 - 7}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Meeting Chair: Kate Min
            \item Notetaker: Jason Tran
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

One deviation from the Development Plan was the decision not to appoint a
primary reviewer for pull requests, as the team deemed it unnecessary to have a
single official ``approver'' in order to merge. Instead, pull requests were
reviewed and approved by team members as needed. \\

Roles related to implementation remained aligned with the Development Plan, with
tasks divided based on each team member's respective strengths, as initially
outlined.

\subsubsection{Workflow Plan}
The workflow plan was generally effective and mostly followed, espcially the
branches and commit naming conventions. However, as deadlines approached, the
naming convention became a lower priority, leading to lapses in ensuring
correctness. The merging strategy was implemented smoothly, with efficient
integration of code contributions. Continuous Integration (CI) was not as much
of a help, as each developer took personal responsibility for validating their
work beforehand. Initially, issue management was often overlooked, but as the
project progressed, it became more important, allowing for better tracking of
tasks and ultimately streamlining the development process. 

\subsection{What Went Well?}

The project benefited from effective communication among team members, which
created a sense of responsibility and collaboration. Team members volunteered to
assist one another, ensuring that tasks were evenly distributed, while
considering individual circumstances. This approach, coupled with a lack of
negative assumptions, allowed for natural assignment of roles based on each
member's strengths. If a team member wanted to challenge themselves, they could
take on a tasks freely. This promoted a learning environment where patience was
encouraged. Expectations among team members remained aligned throughout the
project, contributing to a fluid workflow. \\

The implementation of MongoDB and the migration algorithm was particularly
successful, as the transition from CSV to JSON format proved to be
straightforward. Moreover, working on each other's code allow for a better time
learning within the full-stack development process. Python's capabilities in
analyzing Excel and CSV files performed exceptionally well, as performance-wise
it met all metrics even before optimization. The integration of various
technologies allowed for seamless data handling and processing.

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

Despite the strengths in communication, the team occasionally faced challenges
in aligning with the client's expectations. Ideas exchanged between the team and
the client were often assumed to be a requirement without confirming feasibility
or  timelines, which forces the team to make assumptions or unclear actions. \\

The use of D3 and TypeScript became tedious; distracting the team from what is
really important. The complexity of D3 graph generation was increased by unclear
requirements from the client as well. The learning curve associated with D3 was
steep, and the lack of clear directives resulted in wasted time and effort,
often with backwards progression. Furthemore, the integration of TypeScript
introduced type-related issues that required additional debugging. 

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

If we were given another chance to do this project, there are many things we'd
do differently to address the struggles mentioned above. \\

Firstly, we'd try to consider feasibility of requirements during our meetings
with clients, rather than putting it on the backburner and revisiting it later
to decide whether it was feasible or not. This way, we can avoid making any
assumptions or unclear actions, and gather more information during our meetings
instead of looking back to ask for more details. With a tight deadline, this
would have helped us save a lot of time in doing different iterations. \\

We would also try to look for other technologies that can aid in graph
generation. Learning D3 while trying to do this project caused a lot of delays
in the progress of the project, as it had a steep learning curve. \\

The learning curve of D3 combined with the unclear/unfeasible requirements
provided by our clients introduced unnecessary difficulty into this project. We
had to decline certain requests about graphing as we had to spend time learning
the library and implementing it into our app in the ways we needed it to be. The
request itself was not impossible, rather we had little time to complete the
development of the project.

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

Through this Capstone project, we got the chance to apply the knowledge we
learned from our time here in the Software Engineering program. But the project
also allowed room for us to apply what we learned from working in the industry
as well. 

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

For this project, there were many courses we took that we felt were relevant.
\textbf{Discrete Math I (SFWRENG 2DM3)} - Useful when considering the Boolean state
evaluation of the different components in our project. \\

\textbf{Intro to Software Development (SFWRENG 2AA4)} - A lot of software design
principles and patterns taught from this course was used in developing the
program. Adhering to these principles ensured the project was built in a
maintainable and scalable fashion. \\

\textbf{Databases (SFWRENG 3DB3)} - Understanding the underlying concepts of databases
was very useful. Although we used a NoSQL database for our project,
understanding the idea of how to build the right query to retrieve the desired
data ensured that the application got the correct data that it needs. \\

\textbf{Software Requirements (SFWRENG 3RA3)} - This course was focused heavily around
eliciting requirements, and formatting them into a document that will streamline
the development process. The SRS was one of the most important documents in this
entire project, highlighting the desired results of this project. This includes
what the project should do, and any properties that we want the project to hold. \\

\textbf{Software Design III (SFWRENG 3A04)} - This course was a "mini capstone" over the
span of one semester. It included a pre-determined project, where we had to
write our own documentation, then designing the project, and finally building
it. All the skills acquired from this course could be directly transferred to
our capstone project, since everything done from that course was also done in
our capstone project. \\

\textbf{Software Testing (SFWRENG 3S03)} - This course revolved around testing software,
ranging from the different kinds of tests and how they are used, as well as the
importance of testing. In our capstone project, a lot of testing was required to
be done. It ranged from unit test, system test, useability testing and more.
Tests had to be planned, then performed in order to ensure that the project
meets requirements, and avoids any hazard states. \\

\textbf{Human Computer Interfaces (SFWRENG 4HC3)} - Many of the things done in this
course aimed to teach us how to design and build interfaces, with the user
experience in mind. This was helpful since a lot of the non-functional
requirements focused on the user experience, which were also based on Norman's
design principles along with HCL, which was taught in this course.

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

When building a real project, the courses we take in university by themselves
are not enough. The courses teach us what we are required to do, and a lot of
concepts for software design and development. However, it doesn't teach us about
the possible tech stack that we could use in order to satisfy our requirements. \\

For example, in Databases, we learned how SQL tables are structured, and how
queries are formed. However, in the real world, there are many different SQL
databases. We relied heavily on our internship experiences to decide which
specific technologies we would use for each component.\\

In our own experiences, we gained valuable experience in full stack development,
and UI/UX design. The experiences we have pushed us to lean towards a certain tech 
stack, such as MongoDB for a NoSQL database, GraphQL to handle API requests, and React 
to build the front end. \\ 

It would be much harder to build this project if we chose a tech
stack we were not familiar with, thus our experiences helped us decide on a tech
stack what would make the development process as smooth as possible.
