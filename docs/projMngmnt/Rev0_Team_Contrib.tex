\section{Commits}
Each team member has been working on an individual, dedicated branch for separate features or 
components of the project. Each subsection refers to the commit history of one such branch.
Only currently active branches have been taken into account. 

\subsection{Branch: main} \label{sec:main}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 5 & 100\% \\
Jason Tran & 2 & 40\% \\
Jennifer Ye & 0 & 0\% \\
Kate Min & 2 & 40\% \\
Sumanya Gulati & 2 & 40\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It must be noted that as described in Section 7 - Workflow Plan of the 
\href{https://github.com/SumanyaG/Alkalytics/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan},
commits from milestone specific branches are squashed into a single commit when merged into the
main branch which explains the low count. For example, a commit co-authored by Sumanya and Kate 
to add the Module Guide document to the main branch consists of 13 squashed commits.\\

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 6, 2024 till January 28, 2025. 

\subsection{Branch: frontend-feat/add-dashboard-page} \label{sec:dashboard}

\begin{table}[H]

Kate Min & 2 & 40\% \\
Sumanya Gulati & 0 & 0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 24, 2024 till January 28, 2025.

Sumanya Gulati & 0 & 0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 24, 2024 till January 28, 2025. The commits 
from January 17, 2025 have not been included in the count as they have already been 
accounted for in subsection \ref{sec:dashboard}.

\begin{tabular}{lll}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 24, 2024 till January 28, 2025. The commit

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]

Jason Tran & 0 & 4 \\
Jennifer Ye & 7 & 4 \\
Kate Min & 0 & 4 \\
Sumanya Gulati & 4 & 4 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 6, 2024 till January 29, 2025.
Given the distribution of work and the fact that all assigned components were worked on 
individually by team members, issues were not opened by the team members which explains the 
low count.

\section{Pull Requests}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Pull Requests (O+C)} & \textbf{Percent}\\

Jason Tran & 3 & 50\% \\
Jennifer Ye & 0 & 0\% \\
Kate Min & 1 & 16.67\% \\
Sumanya Gulati & 2 & 33.33\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The period of interest for this subsection is from December 23, 2024 till January 28, 2025.

\section{CICD}

The initial phase of Continuous Integration (CI) was implemented to the project in the form 
of a \LaTeX build checker that flags any compiling issues caused by incorrect syntax, missing 
elements or more. Additionally, Flake8 - a linter for Python and ESLint - a linter for JavaScript have been
implemented using GitHub Actions.
