\section{Commits}
Each team member has been working on an individual, dedicated branch for
separate features or components of the project. Each subsection refers to the
commit history of one such branch. Only currently active branches have been
taken into account.

\subsection{Branch: main}
It must be noted that the period of interest for this is from January 30, 2025 till 
March 26, 2025.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 41 & 100\% \\
Jason Tran & 6 & 14.6\% \\
Jennifer Ye & 11 & 26.8\% \\
Kate Min & 17 & 41.5\% \\
Sumanya Gulati & 19 & 46.3\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It must be noted that as described in Section 7 - Workflow Plan of the
\href{https://github.com/SumanyaG/Alkalytics/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan},
commits from milestone specific branches are squashed into a single
commit when merged into the main branch which explains the low count. For
example, a single commit co-authored by all 4 members on February 22, 2025 consists of 
17 squashed commits. 

\subsection{Branch: rev-1}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}

\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\

Kate Min & 11 & 78.6\% \\
Sumanya Gulati & 0 & 0\% \\
\bottomrule

Please note that the number of commits here only takes into account the commits \emph{not}
included in main, i.e., the number of commits that the current branch is ahead when compared

It must be noted that based on the mutual understanding of all group members, authoring issues has been the duty of the 
current team lead. This means that the team lead for each phase is responsible for authoring all relevant issues for each 
milestone and assigning them to the respective members. This explains the discrepancy in the number of issues authored by 
each team member across all the team contribution reports.
