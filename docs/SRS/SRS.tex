\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
This project aims to aid in the data management and analysis of an ocean
alkalinity enhancement experiment process. The research is working towards a
scalable process to capture CO\textsubscript{2} using a combination of electric
fields and membranes.\\
\newline
The experiment's efficient generation process creates a very dilute base. As earth’s temperature rises,
so does the ocean’s, affects its pH balance. The experimental study aims to provide a solution, to decrease the
ocean's pH levels to be able to absorb more CO\textsubscript{2} which will in
turn help reduce global temperatures.\\
\newline
As the production process to generate this dilute base is still on a small scale, it is currently being perfected
which means many more experiments must be done to be able to bring it to a
global scale. However, this requires a massive production operation to do so.
Optimization of the experimental data is critical to improve process efficiency.
This is a big data software problem requiring the ability to find and fine-tune
specific parameters. 
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
This application will be able to consolidate and organize the data from the
experiments with proper labeling across all given datasets allowing for a
centralize method of data storage that is both scalable and maintainable.\\
\newline
On the application users can request to see certain data points from the inputted data
sets given any specified order. Once the data is returned to the user the
application can show inter-parameter comparability to better aid data analysis.\\
\newline
This comparability acts as a starting point to analysis and is by no means show
a final analysis of the data. This will all be presented in a web interface
where all the user functions will be displayed and can be shared among those
involved in the experiment.   
\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Client}
Dr. Charles de Lannoy serves as the main client for this project as he is the
lead supervisor of the research study. This solution directly affects his work and
is intended to be a custom solution for the problem. Bassel Abdelkader is
another client of this project as he is the person that works directly with the
research data. One of his responsibilities is to record the experimental data and
upload them to their current data storage system, Microsoft Excel. 
\subsection{Customer}
Although this project is a tailored solution to one research study, its
application can be extended to any other situation where large sets of data is
involved. This could be shared among other researchers to aid in their data
management and analysis. Depending on the research team's structure, there could
also be different levels of permissions that can be obtained.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Current student assistants and members of the lab working on the study is can also be
considered stakeholders for the same reasons as the clients. However, since they
will only be working with the study for a short amount of time without daily or
consistent interaction, they do not serve as a main stakeholder. The founder of
the study, who is currently funding the research project is another stakeholder.
However, since they do not work directly with the processes of the study rather
oversee the process, they may not have strong interest in the details of the solution. 
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\label{sec:2.4}
The following is a special type of stakeholder as after this capstone project
term, the project will be passed back to the research team to maintain. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item User name/category: Research project team for maintaining this project post capstone 
  \item User Role: Maintain the codebase, adding new features, fixing potential bugs
  project post capstone
  \item Subject matter experience: Master knowledge on the goals of the research
  project. Master knowledge on how the experiment processes work. 
  \item Technical knowledge: Novice knowledge on the technology stack being
  used in this project, Python, MongoDB, JavaScript, other front-end frameworks 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
\label{personas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item John Doe is an 23 year old McMaster undergraduate student who has a
  research position on the ocean alkalinity research project. They have been
  tasked to aid the experiment data collection process. After being told that
  the data is being stored in a master Excel file; they find that is it hard to
  use. Being an engineering student without much experience with Excel, they
  struggle to find the data they want. Inputting data is still a manageable
  process but they find themselves to be spending a lot of time looking at Excel
  documentation which they find frustrating as that time could be allocated to
  being more productive during the school term. Although, they want to a better
  way to manage the data, they know that it is not up to their decision on what
  tools are being used but suggested that there could be another better solution
  to use. 
  \item Dr.\ Carly Kelvon is a 60 years old professor at a university and
  is working on her own research project for over five years. She has gathered
  lots of data and thankfully she has always been great at Excel. However, other
  the last two years she has found that Excel is becoming less sustainable. The
  queries are a lot slower and sifting through pages and pages of data is
  wasting a lot of her time. She sees this more evidently through those that
  work along side her as they are also facing the same struggles with even less
  Excel experience as her. She wants to find a more scalable solution but she
  fears that her lack of digital knowledge will do her more harm than good, as a
  result she fears that if she introduces a new application to serve her needs
  better that she will find it hard and confusing to use. 
  \item Dr.\ Alex Stark is a 30 year old associate professor who has recently
  gotten funding for his innovative research idea and has been dedicating all
  his time on perfecting its methodology. It has only been one year since his
  research started but had recently found a great application of his ideas to
  reach far more people and be more impactful that he had originally thought.
  But with his current data management set up, he quickly realises that it is not
  sustainable. He finds that there are many other solutions on the market but
  they do not exactly meet his needs and cost a lot more than what he can spend
  on a tool. He decided that the best way is to create his own tool but lacks
  the software knowledge to create something stable and reliable.

Currently, two sources of data input are used -
\begin{itemize}
  \item The CSV files that contain datapoints generated by the apparatus.
  \item The initial parameter values for each experiment such as power voltage, age of membrane, density module and more that are inputted into 
  template excel files. These values are manually inputted by the user and remain constant throughout each experiment.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
This section determines the boundaries of the project to be studied and outlines how it fits into its environment.
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, a system of excel template files is used to store and manage the data. CSV files are generated by the lab apparatus
which are then downloaded and copied onto an `experiment' excel template. This step involves getting rid of redundant data when a single CSV file is
split into multiple excel files and removing inaccurate data (such as rows of zeroes).\\
\newline
This data in the experiment template is then analysed and the results from the analysis of each experiment is then added to another consolidated excel template,
referred to here as `observations' that reords all experiment observations. This observations template also contains additional parameters for each experiment 
such as membrane, configuration and more wich are entered manually by the user.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The path highlighted with blue arrows indicates the current process and how the existing data will be migrated.\\
The path highlighted with green arrows indicates how the product is expected to work after installation.

with regular reviews and adjustments to ensure alignment with goals. Issues are
managed via GitHub and all communications are documented to ensure
accountability. Stakeholder feedback will be integrated throughout the process
to ensure the solution meets evolving requirements.\\
\newline
In addition, project planning will include weekly team meetings, biweekly
supervisor meetings. Deliverables are categorized into stages where roles are
rotated among team members to share responsibility.

\subsection{Planning of the Milestones}

The milestones provide a structured approach to the project's documentation,
planning, and demonstration activities. By the deadlines, the team is expected
to complete and review the documents to ensure accuracy, compliance with project
requirements, and readiness for subsequent stages.

\end{table}

\noindent\textbf{Phase 1} focuses on the Proof of Concept (POC), where the team
is expected to develop and present a functional prototype that demonstrates the
core features and feasibility of the project. This phase focuses on the backend,
including building a database capable of querying and sorting data, and
implementing an algorithm to transfer data from a CSV file into the database
format.\newline\newline
\noindent\textbf{Phase 2} involves the Revision 0 Demonstration, where the
backend is expected to be fully completed according to the project requirements.
In addition, a basic frontend will be developed and integrated into a website to
allow interaction with the backend functionality. It is expected that some bugs
or issues will be displayed. \newline\newline
\noindent\textbf{Phase 3} Phase 3 is the Revision 1 Final Demonstration, where
the final version of the project is presented. During this phase, final frontend
features will be developed to improve the user interface. The backend will be
optimized for performance. Full system testing and debugging will address any
outstanding issues.  This phase represents the culmination of all development
efforts, with a fully functioning product that meets all requirements.
Ultimately, it highlights the project's readiness for production.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
This section includes a list of coversion activities that are necessary that are necessary for the project planning process and outlines a rough timeline for their implementation.
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
The following conversion tasks have been identified as a part of the project planning process.
\subsubsection{Use of Phased Implementation}
The system will not be implemented in phases and would be installed as a part of a single process after testing and approval. This would be done following Stage 7 described in table
\ref{table:2} and Phase 3.

\subsubsection{Data Conversion}
\label{data}
Currently, the files are stored in CSV format. In order to make them compatiable for migration to the new database, the files must be converted into the appropriate format, likely, 
JavaScript Object Notaion (JSON) format. This means that a special program must be written to transport the data as the new system will only accept JSON files. 
The goal is, when a file is inputted to the new system (in CSV format), the program will convert it to JSON so that the data can be entered into the database.

\subsubsection{Major Components}
The product has been decomposed into the following major components that will be put in place based on this timeline - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Database with migrated data and funtionality to compare parameters by the Proof of Concept Demonstration
  \item Interface that allows inputting data and adding new parametersby the end of December 2024
  \item Dashboard that allows analysis of data and visualizing graphs by the end of January 2025
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decomissioning the Old Product}
Based on conversations with primary stakeholders, it has been determined that there is no need to run the new product in parallel with the existing product. After the database is set-up
by Stage 3 as outlined in table \ref{table:2}, all existing data up until that point will be migrated to the new database. The old product will be used to record data from continued experiments
which will be migrated to the new database at the end of each month post Stage 3 and up until Stage 7.\\
\newline
Since the old product is just a collection of spreadsheets, no special effort is needed to decomission them. A visual inspection and testing will be performed by testers and stakeholders 
each time the data is migrated to the new product to ensure its accuracy and integrity.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\subsubsection{Current Technology}
Currently the data is retreived in the form of CSV files and copied onto existing Excel templates that are used to clean, sort and analyse 
the data. Although the templates are sophisticated and well-deisgned, a lot of manual work is involved to flag incorrect data (rows of zeroes for 
all parameters), remove redundant data (the data file is sometimes split into multiple CSV files that might contain some overlapping data) and more.\\
\newline
Some of the collected paramteric data is also inaccurate (such as the power voltage and density module) and so those columns of data are ignored.
To compare different experiments, the user is required to switch between experiment files to view their respective graphs. This is cumbersome and as 
the number of experiments increase, unsustainable in the long-term.

\subsubsection{Data Translation}
A scirpt will be written to automate the translation of files from CSV to JSON format. This has been described in detail in the \nameref{data} section.

\section{Costs}
\emph{N/A}
\section{User Documentation Requirements}
User documentation will cover the more complicated features and functionalities of the website.\\

\noindent This documentation will include how to add new attributes to the dataset, how
to request data plots and any major functionality features.\\ \newline
This document is intended to be a help/tutorial for the end users who will be
using the site for its functionalities. Its target is for those who have limited
software knowledge. Although most functions aims to be as intuitive as possible
to the user, since this is an analysis application there should be documentation
explaining for those who have no idea about how research data works and how to
interact with it using the website.

\subsection{Training Requirements}
No training is required to use the end product.
\section{Waiting Room}
The following requirements are beyond the sophistication of, or time allowed for, initial release of the product.
\subsection{Automatically Download Data from Lab Apparatus}
\textbf{WR-1.}: The product shall automatically download the CSV data files from the lab apparatus and after conversion, upload them to the database.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Rationale}: Currently, the data has to be manually exported from the machine at the end of every week to ensure that the data does not get lost or overwritten.
  \item \emph{Expected Version}: Version 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Dashboard to Generate Data Reports}
\textbf{WR-2.}: The product shall include a dashboard that hosts multiple visual plots that are dynamically updated based on changes in the data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Rationale}: For the initial release, only basic plots that are already being used by the user will be available for viewing. Whenever data is modified, the graph
  must be regenerated to view the updated plot.
  \item \emph{Expected Version}: Version 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine Learning Analysis and Projections}
\textbf{WR-3.}: The product shall use machine learning algorithms to automatically compare parameters and generate visual graphs based on simple text prompts.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Rationale}: The idea is to use artificial intelligence to suggest parametric comparisons or visual graphs that the user might not have though of. The aim is to
  explore analyses that might not have been considered by a user.
  \item \emph{Expected Version}: Version 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mobile Development}
\textbf{WR-4.}: The product shall have a mobile version.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Rationale}: The project can be extended to include a mobile application version of the product to increase accessibility and reachability.
  \item \emph{Expected Version}: Version 4
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use a NoSQL database such as MongoDB instead of a SQL database.
  \item Use JavaScript to implement the interface. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix B --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\
  
  Writing this deliverable gave us greater clarity regarding the project and made us think of questions we hadn't
  considered before such as what our data migration plan would look like, if we need RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and what each role 
  and security level should include and more.\\

  Additionally, we had already acquired significant knowledge about our supervisors' needs/expectations for the project before we began the 
  writing process, which gave us a clearer guide on modelling our requirements and allowed us to start earlier rather than later. As a result, 
  we were able to develop an initial draft, which they reviewed and provided feedback on, enabling us to refine our document in an iterative manner.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?\\
  
  The major pain point for this deliverable was the length and the amount of content that had to be condensed into a single document in such a short
  span of time. With deadline for other courses, coordinating with supervisors and giving them enough time to review our SRS for feedback - most of
  the steps felt rushed. Since the Volere template is so detailed, we also ran into multiple issues where we either did not know what a section or
  sub-section was asking for or figuring out what to write for a non-relevant section that is included in the rubric.\\

  However, we were able to address our questions and concerns through a meeting that we had scheduled with our TA, on top of the informal review session.
  This helped us gain a better understanding of the expectations for each section we faced difficulties with.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to you client(s) or proxies (e.g. your peers,
  stakeholders, potential users)?\\

  Most of our FRs were inspired by our client, primarily our supervisors. Since they do not have a concrete plan for how they want this project implemented
  and instead have an abstract idea of what they would want to see in the product, it gave us a lot more room to be creative and consider multiple scenarios
  for our requirements, ultimately choosing the ones that suit our project the best. Most of the NFRs had to be brainstormed by our team and then validated by
  the stakeholders since they hadn't given much thought to these aspects of the product.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help your team be successful with your capstone project?\\

  3RA3 or Software Engineering Requirements was very helpful in writing up the SRS because we weren't completely clueless and did not have to spend a lot of time
  researching what an SRS is or what requirements are. This meant we could dive straight into work. Another course that has been helpful is 3DB3 or Databases mostly
  because after taking that course, we've had experience dealing with relational databases and were able to determine very early on how a relational database would
  not be the most suitable for our project and thus, pivot towards NoSQL databases.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.\\

  This question was answered individually by all the team members and their responses are as follows:\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Jason Tran\\
    To successfully complete our project, I will need to learn more about backend and data migration. As I have more professional experience with the frontend or
    how to connect the front end to the backend, I will now need to learn the final step of creating the backend itself. This includes how to code with Python and
    how to create algorithms myself.
    \newline
    \item Jennifer Ye\\
    Although I have good skills in writing and team management, the one item that I will need to acquire in this capstone is my back-end knowledge. I know how back-end
    applications works with aspects like APIs and databases as a general concept, but I have no real experience with implementation. With this capstone project being an
    end-to-end project, with a focus on back end, I believe it will be critical for me to grain that knowledge to be an impactful team member to the project.\\
    
    More specifically, I will need to acquire more advanced knowledge of databases and API creation. My strength is in mobile and web development, but since that 
    portion of the project is in the later half of the project, I do not want to wait for then to be impactful. I would like to learn and practice the knowledge throughout the term.
    \newline
    \item Kate Min\\
    I will direct my focus towards machine learning algorithms and NoSQL databases. While I have experience with PostgreSQL, I'm not as familiar with NoSQL/MongoDB to make
    significant contributions at this time.\\
    
    Developing a strong foundation in this area would allow me to contribute meaningfully to the backend development. I don't have much experience in machine learning, but this
    aspect will be essential to our application for data analysis. Successfully acquiring the knowledge needed in both areas will strengthen my ability to work on different parts of the project.
    \newline
    \item Sumanya Gulati\\
    Using version control conventions and such for a large-scale project. In the past, my use of git has been limited to just storing code in a centralized repository that my team
    members could access. We did not do any proper documentation or reviews.\\
    
    This is the first project where our team has come up with a merging strategy, naming conventions and more to keep the git history clean and to ensure conformity and proper documentation.
    In terms of technology, I have never worked with NoSQL databases before so I am looking forward to exploring that!
  \end{enumerate}
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?\\

  This question was answered individually by all the team members and their responses are as follows:\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Jason Tran\\
    I will utilize two approaches on my learning experience, which is to explore resources online and jump straight into the deep end. This will apply what I have learned online in a real application
    which, in my experience, allows me to connect the dots a lot faster. Ultimately, jumping into the deep end will help progress the project along and create an iterative learning style.

    One approach I will use to learn more about API and database creation is to follow tutorial crash courses. With this method, I can have a clearer fundamental understanding on the concepts.
    This might include parts like how they operate, simple manipulation and customization.\\
    
    Another approach which can also serve as a follow up approach will be to use them in practice and to learn as I go. This can be in the form of a quick side project. I will be pursuing both as
    I deem it necessary to be able to succeed in gaining the knowledge in a valuable way. I think learning all the content/knowledge of the back-end from tutorials and cash courses might even be all
    I need to gain the knowledge and contribute to the project on that front.\\
    
    However, with my learning style, I would do better if I also applied the things I learned. This can be done straight from the capstone project, or even having a small side project to just apply
    what I learned before going into the project is another possibility. In conclusion, I will be using the first method to gain the knowledge I need but will also do the second method due to my learning style.

    I don't expect the learning curve from Postgres to MongoDB to be too steep, so either an online course or doing a guided project would be ideal. I would go with the latter approach to gain the necessary
    knowledge/experience quickly, since we'll want to implement the database early on in the development process.\\
    
    Both an online course or a small-scale project would give me a strong foundation in ML models. I'd prefer to take an online course as it would allow me to gain a deeper understanding and more experience
    over time. Since we'll likely focus on implementing the ML at a later time, it will be easier for me to grasp the core concepts and thus make significant contributions to its implementation.

    The two approaches to mastering git and NoSQL databases would be following a tutorial to learn how git works and basic commands; and, just practicing it for all deliverables and learning along the way.\\
    
    I will be leveraging my existing knowledge of git commands and workflows and use it to learn how it can be adapted to large-scale, long-term projects that are maintainable and scalable. As for the NoSQL database,
    I would choose the former strategy and follow a guided tutorial first to familiarize myself with the topic so I can actually contribute to the project.
