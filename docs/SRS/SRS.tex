\subsection{Project Planning}

The team will adopt an agile lifecycle approach, focusing on iterative progress
and adaptability. Work will be organized into stages, milestones, and phases,
with regular reviews and adjustments to ensure alignment with goals. Issues are
managed via GitHub and all communications are documented to ensure
accountability. Stakeholder feedback will be integrated throughout the process
to ensure the solution meets evolving requirements.

In addition, project planning will include weekly team meetings, biweekly
supervisor meetings. Deliverables are categorized into stages where roles are
rotated among team members to share responsibility.

\subsection{Planning of the Milestones}

The milestones provide a structured approach to the project's documentation,
planning, and demonstration activities. By the deadlines, the team is expected
to complete and review the documents to ensure accuracy, compliance with project
requirements, and readiness for subsequent stages.

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

The development phases outline the progression of the project's coding and
implementation efforts. Each phase is focused on achieving significant technical
progress that works alongside the milestones to allow for incremental progress
and continuous refinement.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Stage} & \textbf{Milestone} & \textbf{Deadline} \\
\hline
Phase 1 & POC & November 11 \\
\hline
Phase 2 & Revision 0 Demonstration & February 3 \\
\hline
Phase 3 & Revision 1 Final Demonstration & March 24 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Development Phases and Deadlines}
\end{table}

\textbf{Phase 1} focuses on the Proof of Concept (POC), where the team is
expected to develop and present a functional prototype that demonstrates the
core features and feasibility of the project. This phase focuses on the backend,
including building a database capable of querying and sorting data, and
implementing an algorithm to transfer data from a CSV file into the database
format.

\textbf{Phase 2} involves the Revision 0 Demonstration, where the backend is
expected to be fully completed according to the project requirements. In
addition, a basic frontend will be developed and integrated into a website to
allow interaction with the backend functionality. It is expected that some bugs
or issues will be displayed.

\textbf{Phase 3} is the Revision 1 Final Demonstration, where the final version
of the project is presented. This phase represents the culmination of all
development efforts, with a fully functioning product that meets all
requirements. Ultimately, it highlights the project's readiness for production.


\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
\textbf{Q}: Will you use a phased implementation to install the new system? if so, describe which requirements 
will be implemented by eahc of the major phases?\\
\textbf{A}: No, the system will be installed in a single go after being tested and approved.\\
\emph{Note}: Include cross-references between development tasks, project phases and the Product Use Cases and atomic requirements.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: What kind of data conversion is necessary? Must special programs be written to transport data from an 
existing system to a new one? If so, describe the requirements for these programs here.\\
\textbf{A}: Currently, the files are stored in the CSV format. In order to make them compatiable for migration to the 
new database (MongoDB), the files must be converted into JavaScript Object Notaion (JSON) format. Yes, a special program 
must be written to transport the data as the new system will only accept JSON files. This means that when the file is inputted to the new 
system (in CSV format), a special program must first convert it to JSON so that the data can be entered in the database.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: What kind of manual backup is needed while the new system is installed?\\
\textbf{A}: The installation of the new program should not be a long process and can be accomplished on a day when there are no experiments
being run in the lab. This means, no manual backup would be necessary while the new system is being installed.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: When are each of the major components to be put in place? When are the phases of the implementation to be 
released?\\
\textbf{A}: No phases of implementation to be released. Major components will be put in place based on this timeline - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Database with migrated data and funtionality to compare parameters: Proof of Concept Demonstration
  \item Interface that allows inputting data and adding new parameters: End of December (before Christmas break)
  \item Dashboard that allows analysis of data and visualizing graphs: End of January 
\end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{Q}: Is there a need to run the new product in parallel with the existing product?\\
\textbf{A}: No, there is no need to run the new product in parallel with the existing product. Data can be migrated at regular intervals once
the database is up and running.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Is there any special effort needed to decomission the old product?\\
\textbf{A}: The old product is essentially a collection of spreadsheets so no special effort is needed to decomission them. A visual inspection
and testing might be required after data is migrated to the new product to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\textbf{Q}: Description of current technology that holds data.\\
\textbf{A}: Currently the data is retreived in the form of CSV files and copied onto existing Excel templates that are used to sort and analyse 
the data. Although the templates are sophisticated and well-deisgned, a lot of manual work is involved to flag incorrect data (rows of zeroes for 
all parameters), remove redundant data (the data file is sometimes split into multiple CSV files that might contain some overlapping data) and more.\\
\newline
Some of the collected paramteric data is also inaccurate (such as the power voltage and density module) and so those columns of data are ignored.
To compare different experiments, the user is required to switch between experiment files to view their respective graphs. This is cumbersome and as 
the number of experiments increase, unsustainable in the long-term.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Description of data translation tasks.\\
\textbf{A}: A scirpt will be written to automate the translation of files from CSV to JSON format.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Foreseeable Problems.\\
\textbf{A}: N/A

\section{Waiting Room}
The following requirements are beyond the sophistication of, or time allowed for, initial release of the product.
\subsection{Automatically Download Data from Lab Apparatus}
\textbf{Description}: The product shall automatically download the CSV data files from the lab apparatus and after conversion, upload them to the database.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Currently, the data has to be manually exported from the machine at the end of every week to ensure that the data does not get lost or overwritten.\\
\textbf{Expected Version}: Version 2

\subsection{Dynamic Dashboard to Generate Comparison Reports}
\textbf{Description}: The product shall include a dashboard that hosts multiple visual plots that are dynamically updated based on changes in the data.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: For the initial release, only basic plots that are already being used by the user will be available for viewing. Whenever data is modified, the graph
must be regenerated to view the updated plot.\\
\textbf{Expected Version}: Version 2

\subsection{Machine Learning Analysis and Projections}
\textbf{Description}: The product shall use machine learning algorithms to automatically compare parameters and generate visual graphs based on simple text prompts.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: The idea is to use artificial intelligence to suggest parametric comparisons or visual graphs that the user might not have though of. The aim is to
explore analyses that might not have been considered by a user.\\
\textbf{Expected Version}: Version 3

\subsection{Mobile Development and Accessibility}
\textbf{Description}: The product shall comply with relevant accessibility standards both for the web version and the mobile version.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: The project can be extended to include a mobile application version of the product to increase accessibility and reachability.\\
\textbf{Expected Version}: Version 4
