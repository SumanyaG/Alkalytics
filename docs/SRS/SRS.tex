\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
\textbf{Q}: Will you use a phased implementation to install the new system? if so, describe which requirements 
will be implemented by eahc of the major phases?\\
\textbf{A}: No, the system will be installed in a single go after being tested and approved.\\
\emph{Note}: Include cross-references between development tasks, project phases and the Product Use Cases and atomic requirements.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: What kind of data conversion is necessary? Must special programs be written to transport data from an 
existing system to a new one? If so, describe the requirements for these programs here.\\
\textbf{A}: Currently, the files are stored in the CSV format. In order to make them compatiable for migration to the 
new database (MongoDB), the files must be converted into JavaScript Object Notaion (JSON) format. Yes, a special program 
must be written to transport the data as the new system will only accept JSON files. This means that when the file is inputted to the new 
system (in CSV format), a special program must first convert it to JSON so that the data can be entered in the database.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: What kind of manual backup is needed while the new system is installed?\\
\textbf{A}: The installation of the new program should not be a long process and can be accomplished on a day when there are no experiments
being run in the lab. This means, no manual backup would be necessary while the new system is being installed.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: When are each of the major components to be put in place? When are the phases of the implementation to be 
released?\\
\textbf{A}: No phases of implementation to be released. Major components will be put in place based on this timeline - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Database with migrated data and funtionality to compare parameters: Proof of Concept Demonstration
  \item Interface that allows inputting data and adding new parameters: End of December (before Christmas break)
  \item Dashboard that allows analysis of data and visualizing graphs: End of January 
\end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{Q}: Is there a need to run the new product in parallel with the existing product?\\
\textbf{A}: No, there is no need to run the new product in parallel with the existing product. Data can be migrated at regular intervals once
the database is up and running.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Is there any special effort needed to decomission the old product?\\
\textbf{A}: The old product is essentially a collection of spreadsheets so no special effort is needed to decomission them. A visual inspection
and testing might be required after data is migrated to the new product to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\textbf{Q}: Description of current technology that holds data.\\
\textbf{A}: Currently the data is retreived in the form of CSV files and copied onto existing Excel templates that are used to sort and analyse 
the data. Although the templates are sophisticated and well-deisgned, a lot of manual work is involved to flag incorrect data (rows of zeroes for 
all parameters), remove redundant data (the data file is sometimes split into multiple CSV files that might contain some overlapping data) and more.\\
\newline
Some of the collected paramteric data is also inaccurate (such as the power voltage and density module) and so those columns of data are ignored.
To compare different experiments, the user is required to switch between experiment files to view their respective graphs. This is cumbersome and as 
the number of experiments increase, unsustainable in the long-term.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Description of data translation tasks.\\
\textbf{A}: A scirpt will be written to automate the translation of files from CSV to JSON format.\\
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Foreseeable Problems.\\
\textbf{A}: N/A

  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
