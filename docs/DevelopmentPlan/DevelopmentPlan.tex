\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
\noindent \textbf{Weekly Meetings:}
We will have weekly check-ins on Fridays from 3:30PM to 4:30PM, either in-person 
on campus or virtually, depending on member's availabilities. Virtual meetings 
will be hosted on Microsoft Teams. Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.

The current meeting chair should open a Github issue prior to a meeting. During a 
meeting, the chair will go over each item on a prepared agenda and all members 
participate in the discussion. The notetaker will record meeting minutes and post 
them as a comment under the Github issue after the meeting, as well as a summary of
task assignments.

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor Meetings:}
We will have biweekly or monthly meetings with our primary supervisor, Dr. Charles
De Lannoy, depending on his availabiility. We will be using his Outlook calendar to
arrange appropriate meeting dates. These meetings will be held either in his
office or virtually on Microsoft Teams.

We currently plan to have weekly meetings on Tuesdays from 3:30PM to 4:30PM with
our secondary supervisor, Bassel Abdelkader, as he works closely with the data 
we need to integrate into our project. These meetings will be virtual due
to his schedule.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The team uses an Instagram group chat for regular communication and a Microsoft Teams 
group chat for drafting emails and sharing resources.

We will communicate with our supervisors primarily through email or scheduled meetings.
The team liaison will be responsible for sending the emails and should CC all team
members.

All project-related communication will be done via GitHub issues. Each issue will track
a specific task and assign team members. Every pull request should link to its 
corresponding issue(s), and feedback is expected from all team members when a pull request 
is created.

\section{Team Member Roles}

The team plans to rotate through the following roles between every (or
every few) milestone(s):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Meeting chair}: The meeting chair should prepare an agenda for each
  meeting and open an issue for the meeting. The issue should contain an attendance
  tracker, the agenda, and other topics that may need to be discussed.
  \item \textbf{Notetaker}: The notetaker will record meeting minutes during a 
  meeting and post it as a comment under the meeting issue, along with a summary of 
  task assignments.
  \item \textbf{Primary reviewer for Pull Requests}: The primary reviewer will give
  the official ``approval'' for pull requests. All members should review pull requests
  and provide feedback, but the primary reviewer will make the final decision to
  ensure a smooth workflow.
\end{itemize}

Once we begin implementation, all members are expected to contribute as developers.
However, we anticipate appointing technical leads based on the members' skillsets, 
described below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sumanya has experience in data analytics and working with large datasets,
  and will also serve as the main point of communication between the team and our
  stakeholders.
  \item Kate has experience in web development and programming in Python, as well
  as proficiency in several Python libraries we may need to utilize.
  \item Jason has experience in MongoDB and machine learning, as well as proficiency
  in GraphQL, which we are considering for our data visualization framework.
  \item Jennifer has experience working with large datasets and employing data
  visualization tools like PowerBI, along with a strong background in web development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

By the end of Capstone, our team wishes to deliver a project that is impactful
and useful beyond our graduation. We seek the personal satisfaction that comes from
knowing our product could contribute to improvements in climate change. By achieving 
these goals, we thereby anticipate and hope for an excellent grade in the Capstone
course.

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

All members are expected to attend all weekly check-in meetings, meetings with our
supervisors, and maintain punctuality. We will not require full attendance at every
Capstone lecture or tutorial, as long as at least one member from the team attends.
All forms of attendance will be logged through Github Issues.

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

It will not be acceptable for a member to miss a meeting or a deadline without any
prior communication. Missing a few meetings will be acceptable as long as the member
communicates their absence to the rest of the team at least 1-2 hours in advance.
There will be no acceptable excuses for missing a deadline unless they have an 
emergency. The guidelines for such a situation are outlined in the following section.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

If a team member has an emergency and cannot finish their work or meet a deadline,
they are expected to communicate this as early as possible. The rest of the team will
discuss potential accommodations and ensure that all tasks are completed by the
deadline.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

All members should prepare for weekly check-ins and meetings by doing the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Review the agenda prepared by the meeting chair in advance, and
  \item[(b)] Prepare a short progress report and any questions/concerns that were not
  already mentioned in the agenda.
\end{itemize}

Each member is expected to put in consistent effort and deliver high-quality work
that meets or exceeds the expectations described in the applicable rubric. Code
should be well-structured, well-documented, and adhere to the coding standards
outlined in Section 11 of this document.

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

All members are encouraged to share ideas, ask for feedback/help, and collaborate
harmoniously. Feedback should always be clear, concise, and respectful. We do not
necessitate a Code of Conduct, but if issues begin to arise over the course of the
project, we may consider standardizing one as part of a conflict resolution plan.

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

We will track everything using GitHub and GitHub Projects. We have a Kanban board to
track attendance and tasks for deliverables in the form of GitHub Issues, and other
metrics will be collected by the methods provided in the \href{https://github.com/SumanyaG/Alkalytics/tree/main/docs/projMngmnt}{projMngmnt}
folder of the project repository (e.g., performance metrics).

If uneven contribution becomes a pattern or a team member’s quality of work degrades
over time, the team will try to resolve the issue internally by bringing it to that
member’s attention. Uneven contribution may present itself in the form of fewer
commits or fewer tasks completed despite being assigned, etc. If no improvement is
seen after two internal discussions, the issue will be escalated to our assigned
Teaching Assistant (TA). If there is still no improvement after the TA's involvement,
it will be brought to the instructor's attention.

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

We plan on building team cohesion through our interactions outside of the Capstone
project. As we all have similar class schedules, we have numerous opportunities to
interact and work with each other in environments that differ from the Capstone
project. 

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

Decisions are to be made through a majority vote and should only be made after the
team has had a thorough discussion. In the event of a tie, we may approach our
supervisors for their input if it is relevant for them.
